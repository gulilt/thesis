Gulce's Master Thesis Project

Hello everyone! For my MSc in Marketing thesis I’m doing an analysis of the following data. 
My main purpose is getting into the reasonings behind sales with publicly available economic data, 
in order to understand the drives of consumer decision-making processes – especially when it comes 
to a purchase with a considerable amount of commitments, starting with the price itself. 
But of course, in an economic climate like Turkey’s it’s quite impossible to pinpoint 
to only one independent variable that would change the whole behavior. Let’s see how this goes!

Research Question:
“What economic factors influence Turkish consumers' car purchase and ownership decisions as 
they navigate the complexities of the economy?” 
This study aims to explore the decision-making process behind car purchases among 
Turkish consumers, particularly under the strains of an unpredictable economy.
